# Cipher Hub - Go-based Key Management Service Project Specification

## Project Overview

Cipher Hub is a comprehensive, containerized key management service built in Go that serves as a centralized security layer for cryptographic operations across distributed systems. The service acts as a sidecar component that handles the complete lifecycle of encryption keys, from generation to secure destruction, while providing standardized APIs for key operations.

The service abstracts away the complexity of cryptographic key management from application services, similar to how OAuth/OIDC standardizes authentication flows. Applications can focus on their core business logic while delegating all key-related operations to this specialized service.

## Core Capabilities

### Service Registration Management

The system manages service registrations as logical containers for related participants (users, devices, services) that share cryptographic contexts. Each service registration acts as a security boundary with its own access controls, audit trails, and key policies.

### Comprehensive Key Lifecycle Management

- **Key Generation**: Creates cryptographically secure keys using Go's crypto/rand package for multiple symmetric and asymmetric algorithms including AES-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA, and ECDSA
- **Key Storage**: Implements secure persistence with encryption at rest, proper access controls, and secure memory handling
- **Key Distribution**: Provides secure APIs for authorized key retrieval with proper authentication and authorization checks
- **Key Rotation**: Automated and manual key rotation with configurable schedules, key versioning, and gradual migration support
- **Key Derivation**: Key derivation functions (KDF) for generating multiple keys from master keys using standards like HKDF and PBKDF2

### Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Multi-layered authentication supporting API keys, JWT tokens, and mutual TLS
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions for different key operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all key operations with tamper-evident logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and abuse prevention mechanisms
- **Secure Communication**: TLS-encrypted communication with certificate validation

### Operational Excellence

- **High Availability**: Designed for distributed deployment with leader election and state synchronization
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics, health checks, and observability features
- **Backup/Recovery**: Secure backup mechanisms with encrypted key material export/import
- **Graceful Operations**: Proper shutdown procedures with secure memory cleanup

## Technical Architecture

### Container-First Design

Built specifically for containerized environments with support for:

- Sidecar deployment patterns within container orchestration platforms
- Environment-based configuration management
- Health check endpoints for container health monitoring
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup

### Go Standard Library Focus

Leverages Go's robust standard library extensively:

- `crypto/*` packages for cryptographic operations
- `net/http` for REST API server
- `encoding/json` for API serialization
- `database/sql` for persistence layer
- `context` for request lifecycle management
- `sync` for concurrent operations

### Storage Architecture

Multi-tier storage approach:

- **Memory Layer**: High-performance caching for frequently accessed keys
- **Persistent Layer**: Encrypted database storage for key material
- **Backup Layer**: Secure export/import capabilities for disaster recovery
