# Cipher Hub

My original stab at this tried to do too many things all up front, so I'm rebooting this process using the lessons learned from the last attempt. Before I press forward with this project, I plan to:

* Build a fundamental level of familiarity working with the Go [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/).
* Refine and validate my AI-integrated workflow on smaller scale projects before transitioning to something like this with larger scope.
* Aggregate all of the relevant project artifacts derived from the initial attempt, and spend an appropriate amount of time in the project planning phase establishing a well thought out, realistic execution plan for this project.
