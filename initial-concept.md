# Go-based Private Key Management Service

[Conversation](https://claude.ai/chat/0337ead6-b201-4b1b-99fd-f44194ac0c75)

I have the following concept for a service that I would like to build along with you in order to build a better understanding of Go. I'm already familiar with other languages like C# and TypeScript, but have minimal experience with Go.

## Big Picture Concept

Use Go to build a containerized key management service for different standard encryption algorithms associated to users, devices, and services (the **participant**). This service will be responsible for:

* Registering associated participants under the context of a **service registration**.
* For each service registration, handle:
  * **Key Generation** - Creating cryptographically secure random keys
  * **Key Storage** - Secure persistence of keys with proper access controls
  * **Key Distribution** - Secure sharing between authorized users/services
  * **Key Rotation** - Scheduled replacement of keys to limit exposure
  * **Access Control** - Authentication and authorization mechanisms

The intent of this service will be to allow other services that encrypt data to offload handling of private key management around the standardized flow of this service. Think of this as OAuth / OIDC for private encryption keys.

### Example

A secure data transfer service leverages AES-256 to compress, encrypt, and stream chunks of data from its origin to one or more participants. Instead of having to be concerned with service registration and key management, the data transfer service can be built around this standard key management platform and focus primarily on the speed and efficiency of its data transfer algorithm.

## Guidelines

* I want to work with Go and its standard library as natively as possible, so I would like to avoid importing any modules that aren't absolutely necessary.
* We will work through this slowly so ensure your responses and generated artifacts are focused around small, digestible chunks that allow me to follow along and build a comprehensive understanding of what is being built.

## Prompt

Before getting started, I would like for you to evaluate this project and determine:

* Viability of the project
* Improvements that can be made to the scope and execution
* Suggestions for scoping each milestone of the project

## Response

This is a solid and viable project that will give you excellent exposure to Go's strengths in building secure, concurrent services. Let me break down my evaluation:

### Viability Assessment

**Highly Viable** - This project hits several sweet spots:

* Go excels at building secure network services with its robust standard library
* The crypto packages in Go's stdlib are production-ready and well-designed
* Container/sidecar architecture aligns perfectly with Go's deployment model
* The scope is challenging but manageable for learning purposes

### Suggested Improvements

**Architecture Refinements:**

* Consider making this a "Key Management as a Service" rather than just private keys - you'll likely need both symmetric and asymmetric operations
* Add audit logging from the start - key management without audit trails is rarely production-worthy
* Plan for high availability early, even if you implement it later

**Security Enhancements:**

* Include key derivation functions (KDF) alongside key generation
* Consider implementing key versioning to support gradual rotation
* Add rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse

**Operational Considerations:**

* Include health check endpoints for container orchestration
* Plan for graceful shutdown and key material cleanup
* Consider backup/recovery mechanisms for key material

### Milestone Suggestions

**Phase 1: Core Foundation**

* Basic HTTP server with health endpoints
* In-memory key storage structure
* Simple key generation for AES-256
* Basic participant registration

**Phase 2: Security Layer**

* Authentication mechanism (API keys or JWT)
* Access control for key operations
* Secure key storage (encrypted at rest)
* Basic audit logging

**Phase 3: Key Lifecycle**

* Key rotation scheduling
* Key versioning and retrieval
* Key distribution endpoints
* Configuration management

**Phase 4: Production Readiness**

* Persistent storage backend
* Container configuration
* Monitoring and metrics
* Error handling and recovery

**Phase 5: Advanced Features**

* Multiple encryption algorithms
* Key derivation functions
* Backup/restore capabilities
* Performance optimization

This approach lets you build understanding incrementally while creating something genuinely useful. Each phase builds naturally on the previous one, and you'll be working with Go's strengths throughout - goroutines for concurrency, interfaces for clean abstractions, and the excellent crypto stdlib.

Would you like to start with Phase 1, or would you prefer to dive deeper into any particular aspect of the design first?

## Prompt

Your suggested improvements are valid and should be considered core to the requirements of this project. Please generate an artifact that outlines:

* a detailed description of the project (no code or file structure, simply the details of what the project will be)
* A roadmap of the milestones, with a summary of each checkpoint within the milestone
